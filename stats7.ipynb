    "- **Variance Calculation:** The variances of the two datasets (var1 and var2) are calculated using np.var with ddof=1 to get the sample variance.\n",
    "- **F-value Calculation:** The F-value is calculated as the ratio of the larger variance to the smaller variance. This ensures that the F-value is always greater than or equal to 1.\n",
    "- **Degrees of Freedom:** The degrees of freedom for the numerator (dfn) and the denominator (dfd) are determined based on which variance is larger.\n",
    "- **p-value Calculation:** The p-value is calculated using the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the F-distribution (f.cdf). The p-value represents the probability of observing an F-value as extreme as, or more extreme than, the one calculated, under the null hypothesis that the variances are equal.\n",
